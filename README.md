# SRNM: Sparse Recurrent Neural Model

This is an attempt to capture some aspects of the human brain in a general neural model. The hope is that this model
is
 - capable of scaling to a large number of simultaneous tasks, while limiting effects from Catastrophic Forgetting
 - dynamic or self-adaptive, similar to how brain neurons are continuously re-wired based on experience

## Working process

 - [ ] Implement simple XOR problem
